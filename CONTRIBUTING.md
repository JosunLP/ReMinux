# Contributing to ReMinux

Thank you for taking the time to contribute! The guidelines below keep the codebase consistent and the review process smooth.

---

## Getting started

1. **Fork** the repository and create a branch from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-improvement
   ```
2. Make your changes (see the coding conventions below).
3. Run the syntax checker on every changed Lua file:
   ```bash
   luac5.1 -p path/to/file.lua
   ```
   Install with `sudo apt-get install lua5.1` if it is not available.
4. Open a pull request against `main`.

## Code conventions

### Language and style
- **All code, comments, commit messages, and documentation must be in English.**
- Lua 5.1 (the version embedded in CC: Tweaked) is the target language.
- Use `local` for every variable that does not need to be global. Never pollute `_G` from a script unless intentionally registering a system-wide value.
- Follow **DRY** (Don't Repeat Yourself): extract repeated logic into local helper functions.
- Prefer **OOP** where a stateful entity is involved (see `etc/api/apt` for the `AptManager` class pattern).

### Naming
| Kind | Convention | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| Local variables | `camelCase` | `lineCount`, `authType` |
| Constants | `UPPER_SNAKE` | `AUTH_DIR`, `NO_USER` |
| Functions (module API) | `camelCase` | `readLines`, `buildFromDirectory` |
| Classes | `PascalCase` | `AptManager` |

### File structure
- Scripts under `bin/` are user-executable command wrappers. They should be thin: validate input, call the appropriate API function, print the result.
- APIs under `etc/api/` contain the actual logic. Keep scripts and logic separated.
- Manual pages live in `etc/man/<name>.man` and are plain text.

### Error handling
- Validate all function arguments with `expect()` in public API functions.
- Return `false` (or an error code) on failure — do not `error()` from top-level scripts.
- Print user-readable messages for failures, not raw error strings.

## Pull request checklist

- [ ] All changed Lua files pass `luac5.1 -p`
- [ ] No new global variable leaks in `bin/` scripts
- [ ] Manual page added or updated if a command changed
- [ ] Commit messages are in the imperative mood ("Add …", "Fix …", "Remove …")
- [ ] PR description explains *what* changed and *why*
